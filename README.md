The program is designed to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. It takes as input a text file containing a collection of puzzles, where each line represents a puzzle in its initial state, with either digits from 1 to 9 or blank cells. The goal is to fill in each blank cell with a digit such that every digit appears exactly once in every row, column, and 3x3 square.

The program utilizes an algorithm to iteratively fill in the blank cells with the valid digits and validate the solution's compliance with the rules of the puzzle. The algorithm runs until a solution is found or all possible combinations have been exhausted.

Upon finding a solution, the program outputs the correctly filled in puzzle, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 square contains a unique set of digits from 1 to 9.

The focus of the implementation is on finding the solution as efficiently as possible, ensuring its scalability to handle large collections of puzzles.
